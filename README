Running make all will generate six binaries in the same directory, which are namely mnist, 3d_pro, cifar, birch1, birch2, birch3 for the respective data sets.
To add a new data set, you'll have to modify at two places:
1. main.h : Add an entry in the form
	#ifdef SOME_NAME
	#define NUM_POINTS // number of points in the data set
	#define DIMENSION // dimensionality of data set
	#define ROUNDED_DIMENSION //the nearest higher power of 2
	#define NUM_CLUSTER // number of clusters
	#define ROUNDED_CLUSTER // the nearest higher power of 2
	#define DATA "name_of_file" // data file should be present at ../data/name_of_file
	
2. makefile: Add an entry in the form
	g++ -D SOME_NAME  main.cpp -std=c++11 -O3 -msse4.2 -fopenmp -o  name_of_binary
	
Running the code (example of MNIST):
First set the number of threads on terminal with "export OMP_NUM_THREADS=20"
For random: ./mnist random 50 where 50 is the number of runs
For kmeans++: ./mnist kmeans++ 50 
For d2-seeding: ./mnist d2-seeding 50 10 will run 50 times with N=10k
For kmeans||: ./mnist kmeans-par 50 2 5 will run 50 times with l = 2k and r=5

Results will be available in ../logs/mnist/
Individual run log are present as:
random_threads=20_runNo=*.txt
kmeans++_threads=20_runNo=*.txt
d2-seeding_N=10k_threads=20_runNo=*.txt
kmeans-par_l=2k_r=5_threads=20_runNo=*.txt
								  
Mean and standard deviations are present as:
random_threads=20_result.txt
kmeans++_threads=20_result.txt
d2-seeding_N=10k_threads=20_result.txt
kmeans-par_l=2k_r=5_threads=20_result.txt
